you need both normal and

you take too many antibiotics

the abnormal organisms so
the balance is shifted and you
get symptoms. now let me
give you a list of things you
can do: if sexually active
abstinence at least till you are
fully better. also have your
partner checked. check his
urine and semen for any
significant infection. have a
urine culture and sensitivity if
there is any sterile pyuria that
is pus cells without any growth
have only the sensitive
antibiotics for the minimum
duration. get a vaginal swab
for culture and sensitivity.
antifungals and antibiotics can
be used if needed. get your
blood sugars and thyroid
profile checked. avoid vaginal
douches. use bland or inert
vaginal washes just to wash
the exterior. and no need to
use an unnecessary vaginal
suppository. keep the perineal

as seen in your brief history
there are some fluctuations in
your blood pressure as well as
heart rate. i would advise you
to get an ecg done as soon as
possible as we have to see
what sort of heart rhythm are
you on. the doctor who has
suggested you propranolol
must have done your ecg. so if
it is a sinus rhythm (normal
fluctuating rhythm) then it is
not much to worry about. but if
it is some sort of abnormal
rhythm (arrhythmia) then it
has to be taken care of.
secondly propranolol 20 mg
thrice a day is quite a heavy
dose. propranolol 10 mg twice
a day should be started and
should be increased every
week if required. if you are
having chest discomfort after
having propranolol then just
drop the medication for this
morning and noon and see if
you are normal. as of now i

i completely emphasize with
you. the problem of premature
ejaculation is quite common
and is distressing to a young
man but is seldom discussed.
see most of the time the
problem is secondary to the
anxiety attached to your
expectations in the bed. it has
been wrongly projected by
unscientific magazine articles
and porn that a man can last
for 30 minutes or more.
honestly most of the male
ejaculate before 5 minutes.
when you are anxious about
not lasting long in bed you
actually do not enjoy the act of
intercourse and keep on
thinking about prolonging the
act without enjoying it. the
preoccupation and anxiety
about not lasting enough in
fact cause hyperarousal and
lead to premature ejaculation.
moreover when the male start
to thrust himself into the
partner the moment he
undress leads to early
termination of coital act (the
sexual union that takes place
between male and female
during insertion of penis into
the vagina). there are also lots
of young man who are
suffering from premature
ejaculation without any
associated anxiety or
apprehension. such men as

i fully appreciate your
concerns. you have not
mentioned whether thyroid is
underworking or overworking.
thyroid gland produces thyroid
hormone. thyroid hormone
deficiency occurs if thyroid
gland is underactive
(hypothyroidism). under these
circumstances the patient
needs daily dose of thyroid
hormone supplementation. no
other treatment is required. if
thyroid gland is hyperactive
(hyperthyroidism) medicines
to curb hyperactivity are given.

advice if you send me thyroid

i read your query and
understand the concern
expressed by you. in regard to
the current medication i would
like to inform you that parocen
cr is one option for premature
ejaculation but does not have
any effect on weak erection. it
can be said that in last three
years a new molecule is
approved for the treatment of
premature ejaculation which is
equally effective and do not
have common side effects
encountered with parocen cr
or other drugs which were in
use three years back. i am not
sure why your doctor
prescribed you nano leo as it
has minimal effect on
erection. it is used for
increasing testosterone level
which has more effect on
desire rather than erection. as
you informed that you do not
have any problem with desire
the possibility of using nano
leo is ruled out. regarding the
viagra it has definite effect on
erection and there is no doubt
that it can be effective in your
case. having said this i would
like to know what was your
initial problem premature
ejaculation or weak erection? i
commonly observed that
people with erection problem
try to rush the sexual
intercourse because of fear
that they will not able to
maintain the erection for
sufficient time. this kind of
rushing develops artificial
premature ejaculation. i need
to inform you that if you
developed your premature
ejaculation in response to
erection problem then there is
need to treat only erection
problem. as the cause
suggests with treatment of
erection problem the
premature ejaculation will be
treated automatically. in case
you feel that both the
problems are independent
then there is need to address
both issues simultaneously for
correction of the problem.
before we move to treatment
part of the problem we need to
identify the possible cause of
the problem. i request you to
post following details in the
follow up query so that the
cause of problem can be
determined and so the
treatment. 1. what do you
mean by weak erections and
premature ejaculation?
describe what you think in
detail. 2. how did the problem
start whether it was of acute
onset or was it on and off
initially? 3. progress of the
problem in the last six months.
4. duration of sexual activity -
both maximum and minimum
duration in last one year. 3.
frequency of the problem in a
week or in a month. 4. what
are the factors that increase
the problem in bedroom. 5.
factors that relieve the
problem - thoughts situations
partner place etc. 6. do you
get early morning or night
erections? 7. if yes how                                \r\n\r\n\r\n Hello doctor,\nI am a

please do cbc (complete blood

before starting dexona
(dexamethasone) as it is a
steroid. also there may be a
history of childhood asthma
(hyper-reactive airway
disease) and it is better to be
sure before giving this
medicine. this mostly looks
like hyper-reactive airway
disease for which the initial
treatment is a common cough
and cold medicines. if this
does not reduce then you
should add dexona or even
better hydrocortisone. later on
you should add montelukast
and if this also does not take
care of the issue then
nebulization with duolin
(salbutamol and ipratropium)
and budecort (budesonide) is
advised. the last drug route of
choice is inhalers. these are
the steps involved in the
treatment and control of
hyper-reactive airway disease.
this treatment plan should be
made by a physician in person
after detailed evaluation. as of
now you can use dexona but
with the consent of the
physician and after the tests
that i told you so that we can
be sure that there is no

details about his medical
history. did he ever had
gingival bleeding epistaxis
(nose bleeding) or any
spontaneous bruising? any
history of dark foul smelling

evidence of viral illness like
fever or diarrhea or upper
respiratory tract infection?
does he have any
splenomegaly? itp is a primary
immune mediated destruction
of platelets by self-generated
antibodies to platelets. it is of
two types acute and chronic.
acute itp usually follows
infection and has spontaneous
resolution in eight weeks or
two months. chronic itp
persists longer than six
months without any cause.
management includes
conservative and observation

have any signs of bleeding or
mild cutaneous manifestations

complications i order to
suppress immune mediated
destruction of platelets which
will require iv immunoglobulin

conservatively and continuous
watch on bleeding
manifestations should be
followed. if the condition
persists for more than six
months that is if it progresses
to chronic itp then drugs like
eltrombopag and nplate -

stimulate platelet production
for the one who experience
inadequate response to

stammering has got a multiple
etiology and pathogenesis. a
hereditary component in this
has been extensively studied.
a recent study was done
including 12 children and 5
generations of the family were
investigated. the hereditary
component is not the only
thing that is important. there
are other factors related to
environmental like the way
children are brought up the
circumstances the child faces
etc. which will decide this.
chances of the heriditary
component are variable
accordingly to different
studies. it differs with the
genetic component of mother

                                                         years old. I have been suffering

                                                         pain for about six months now. I

                                                         negative for infection. I used to

i have read through your
complaint and the relevant
details. tooth gaps in the front
are inherited in families to a
certain extent. a study has
even proved that there is as
high as 62. 5% of patients
have midline gap running in
families. you also have
mentioned that one of your
incisor teeth is rotated. this
means the tooth has adjusted
to space during the eruption of
other permanent teeth in that
row. these midline gaps can
be easily corrected. there are
a lot of methods to correct
them. but considering your
age i advise you to visit your
nearby orthodontist that is
braces specialist to analyse
the condition. you need not
worry that your teeth are
deteriorating because gap
closure treatment through
braces does not involve any
grinding of any tooth. also i
would recommend you to
choose braces treatment in
order to correct the rotated
tooth as well as the closure of

your infection will be most
probably a viral infection
because of the season now.
however we can be sure of
that only after a swab is taken
and it is cultured to see if
there grows any bacteria in it. i
give you the following
suggestions to take care of
the problem. however only
after a thorough examination i
will able to arrive at a more
confirm diagnosis and institute
decisive treatment.
levocetirizine can be
continued in the night alone.
mostly the dose prescribed is
5 mg. for cough try some
cough lozenges which can be
taken orally. some
expectorant syrup will help
lighten the mucus and help
cough the sputum out better. if
you get fever take
paracetamol 650 mg. take
abundant rest if fever ensues.
if fever present then it is
prudent to consult a doctor
and take the appropriate
antibiotics. cold and nasal
congestion can be alleviated
using nasal decongestant
drops like xylometazoline 0.
1% or oxymetazoline 0. 05%.
take three drops in each
nostril and lie down for 10
minutes. thereafter take steam
inhalation. this i suggest you
to do twice daily for three
days. take salt water gargles
three to four times a day. take
plenty of hot fluids and refrain
from having any cold products
or drinks. avoid smoking and
drinking during the course of
all these medications. better to
avoid them altogether. if fever
does not relieve then you must
consult a doctor. it could be
worsening and you may
require antibiotics or
injections. if you get throat
pain then it is a sign of
inflammation and salt water
gargles will be helpful.
because of throat infection
your nodes may get enlarged
and become painful. if cough
is not productive and if it is dry
you should be seen by a
doctor to ascertain if any
wheeze is present. if so you
have to take bronchodilators
to ease the bronchial
passages for air and mucus to
pass through. as the details
provided are insufficient and i
have not examined you i
cannot be decisive whether
the infection is a viral or
bacterial one. i cannot be sure
regarding whether the upper
respiratory tract presentation
is of some other disease like
dengue leptospirosis h1n1 etc.
however the latter chances
are less do not worry for now.
but promptly consult with a
doctor in case you are not
relieved of symptoms. here i
would like to emphasize the
importance of green leafy
vegetables to be taken daily
nutritious protein rich food
regular exercise and breathing
exercise which if performed
regularly can help prevent
such infections. differential

hypochondroplasia is a rare
and genetically inherited
condition. it involves the
skeletal system and the child's
height and weight are
definitely low. and birth history
also suggests some
abnormality. what about the
parents status is anyone
affected or are they normal?
very rare tests have been
performed and he has been
examined at reputed institutes
and already seen by genetic
specialist. the child needs a
multispeciality/multidisciplinary
approach: 1. he might not
reach normal height. there is
no specific treatment for that.
growth hormone which we use
in other conditions would not
help him. there are some limb
lengthening surgeries done
later in life. these are complex
surgeries which involves
orthopaedics and should be
done in multispeciality setups.
some other movement
restrictions can occur at
elbows/knees and these can
be managed by
orthopaedicians and helped
by physiotherapists. 2.
enlarged head due to more
fluid in the brain. this rarely
requires surgery and can be
done by a neurosurgeon. mri
brain does not show any such
features now. if any symptoms
appear then probably he will
need a repeat mri. 3. fits occur
in a few children. this can be
treated at any children's
centre and can be seen by a
paediatrician or a neurologist.
4. with respect to the
development special
teaching/training programs
might be required.
psychological support is
needed as the child grows up
which can be rendered by a
child psychologist/psychiatrist.
5. hearing problems are
frequent and hence get
regular check ups done by an
ent specialist/paediatrician
who will guide you.
unfortunately there are no
medications to cure this
disease. genetic disorders can
affect many body systems. the
best we can do is treat the
symptoms that are caused.
there are more severe forms
of the disease which can be
life threatening.
hypochondroplasia is only a
milder form. hope this

you do not have to worry
about pregnancy. any young

may miss your periods. next

if you are having delayed
period there could be lots of
reasons for it. first on the list is
pregnancy which you have
ruled out already. second
cause could be pcod which
gives rise to multiple tiny cysts
in your ovaries with failure in
ovulation thereby leading to
no menstruation. third cause
is hormonal imbalance or
thyroid related issues. so i
would suggest you to check
your thyroid and prolactin

your menses these years and
this is the first episode at 53
years of age when the
menses have been delayed by
two weeks the causes can be
a possible initiation of
perimenopausal stage where
menses are often delayed for
a month or two and slowly
tend to stop in next one to two
years. perimenopausal stage
can be verified with the

from the way you described it
seems that you have a locked
back. so you need a few
medicines and physiotherapy.
instructions to reduce back
pain and stiffness are as
follows: avoid lifting heavy
weights sitting for a long time
and two wheeler rides. avoid
arching your back; instead
bend your knees to pick up
something from the floor.
improve your posture while
sitting and try to get up from
your chair for every 20
minutes. take a quick walk
around then continue working
and always sit on a chair with
back support. do not get up
suddenly from a sleeping
position. rather turn to the side
and then get up. take bed rest
if you feel severe pain. do hot
fomentations locally over the
affected area at least twice a
day. i suggest you to apply
oxalgin gel (diclofenac) for
local application twice a day. i
also suggest tablet pregabalin
75 mg one tablet at night for
15 days before food at 7 pm
every day and tablet etoricoxib
60 mg one tablet at morning
and night for 10 days after
food. you can take
rabeprazole 20 mg one tablet
at night for 10 days before
food and shelcal (calcium
carbonate and vitamin d3) 500
mg one tablet at morning and
night for 30 days before food.
take d-shine 60 k one tablet
daily for ten days and then
once a month for 11 months.
take these tablets only if you
are not allergic to them.
consult your specialist doctor
discuss with him or her and
take the medicine with their
consent. these tablets will also
help the heaviness of the
head. if back stiffness does
not reduce then you will need
some blood investigation. do
physiotherapy like mckenzie
back extension exercises back
core strengthening exercises
glute strengthening exercises
and passive straight leg
raising exercises. these
exercises can be done initially
under a supervision of a
physiotherapist or learn to do
it at home. only regular
exercises can give the result.
once the pain gets reduced
then do the following activities
like swimming yoga and
walking which are good for
you. jogging running and
weight lifting may aggravate
back problems. the probable
causes:1. locked back. 2.

i understand your concern.
swimming is considered as a
safe recreational activity. but
that is not totally true.
chlorination of water is known
to kill most of the
microorganisms (which
include bacteria viruses fungi
and parasites). but there are
several factors to be
considered like: 1) type of
microorganism (some
organisms may be resistant to
chlorination). 2) adequate
chlorination (if sufficient
chlorine is not added there
could be a chance of acquiring
infection). 3) duration of
chlorination (when a
microorganism is introduced
into the water the chlorine
may not kill the organism right
away some resistant
organisms may survive longer
in the water). 4) microbial load
(the stage of infection of the
infected person is also
important during the acute
acute/highly infective stage
chances of spreading infection
may be higher). it is very
important for people with skin
infections or diarrhoea to stay
away from the pools for a
period of 14days after
recovery. this can only be
monitored by the people
entering the pool themselves.
if you are swimming regularly
try not to swallow water while
swimming. take a shower
immediately after swimming. if
you develop any symptoms
like rashes over the skin or
diarrhoea consult your doctor
immediately. request the pool
authorities to put up a notice
requesting members to stay
away from the pool if they are
sick. if you have kids who are
swimming follow the same
advice and change their
nappies immediately after
swimming. also take your kids                             \r\n\r\n\r\n Hello doctor, I wonder

i have understood your
concern. dislocation is
accidental slippage of bone
from the actual space and
when it happens it will make
surrounding muscles
ligaments and capsule over
stretch and so ultimately pain
will be due to all structures.
first you need to strengthen
the surrounding muscles
perfectly with the faith that you
will improve. it may take six
months or more. do not worry
about it and you need to have
more patience. in supervision
of skilled physiotherapist you

worry as everything is going to
be fine if proper care and
treatment is opted in for. i
have thoroughly gone through
your case and understand
your genuine health concerns.
the probable causes:this is a
very common problem for a lot
of treadmill users doing cardio
exercises. the main issue is
the sensitivity of the skin. it
looks very simple but i found
this fact after a research on
150 people of different ages
and with different health status
but with the same issue of
blushing and itching on the
legs while using the treadmill.
reasons: dry skin in the legs.
wearing tight clothes/jeans or
trousers while exercising on
the treadmill. wearing tight
and above ankle socks.
treatment plan:1. wear cotton-
only trousers (100% cotton;
not mixed with any synthetic
fiber). 2. it is better to wear
ankle socks compared to
above ankle socks. 3. wax
properly and timely on the
legs and apply eucerin cream
(extra dry treatment lotion) on
the legs especially when
doing the treadmill. 4. there
must be a proper ventilation in
the room where you do the
treadmill. 5. keep a judicious
supply of water to avoid
dehydration. 6. you need to
keep a good and healthy diet
full of vitamins minerals and
fluids (vegetables salads fruits
salmon fish nuts dry fruits). 7.
avoid caffeinated drinks like
coffee tea beverages energy
drinks etc. 8. it is possible that
you may still feel itching and
redness for the first couple of
days so it is better to take
tablet cetirizine 1 hour before
workout. and apply
hydrocortisone cream if you
feel that the redness is not
going away on its own after an
hour of completing workout. in
a few days you will not get the                             \r\n\r\n\r\n Hi doctor,\nEvery time

                                                         problem started three years back
                                                         for the first time when I started
                                                         taking dumbbells for exercise. As
                                                         I did not know from how much
                                                         weight should I start, I took 20 kg
                                                         (10 kg in each hands). Within a
                                                         week of exercise I felt shortness
                                                         of breath and so I stopped doing
                                                         it and visited a doctor. He told
                                                         me to take ECG and it came out
                                                         normal, but I had higher pulse
                                                         rate. When he checked my BP it
                                                         was also high like 140/90
                                                         mmHg. So, he prescribed
                                                         Nebicard 2.5 one tablet per day
                                                         in the morning and it brought
                                                         down my heart rate and BP.

                                                         higher pulse happens. So, I

                                                         lying down and he told there is

as you are 21 year old the
acne is mainly due to
hormonal changes. as far as
scars are concerned do not
peel or squeeze your acne.
the scars which are already
present can be lightened off.
for acne try herbal things at
home because the cause is
very important. as your
hormones will get balanced
with age the acne will start
reducing. take turmeric and
sandalwood powder and add
rose water to it. make a paste
and apply this paste early in
the morning. after 10 minutes
wash it off gently with water
and wipe your face with a soft
cotton towel. for scars i
suggest you apply aloe vera
gel on them twice a day. this
will help in lighting them. use
mild herbal face wash and do
not use harsh soap for face.
avoid going directly in sunlight
apply sunscreen before going
outside. avoid taking the
stress avoid excessive spicy
and junk food caffeinated
drinks etc. drink plenty of
liquids and take fresh fruits
and vegetables. however if
acne is due to some infection
then you need to visit a nearby
dermatologist otherwise

pimple is somewhat hormonal
and due to oily skin.
remember the following
measures to control pimples.
do not use hair oil and avoid
oily foods chocolates and milk
products. do not use any
steroid creams. face wash and
soaps are not the treatment
and they do not help. do not
touch the acne and avoid
pressing it. regarding
treatment of pimple i suggest
clindamycin (clintop faceclin or
clear gel). this is more of
preventive and curative so i
tell patients to use it all over
face in the morning and use
adapalene gel (adapalene or
differin) over acne in the night.
i also suggest you to take
tablet doxy (doxycycline) 100
mg once in a day. consult your
doctor discuss with him/her
and take the medicine with
consent. if you have acne
marks avoid direct sunlight
exposure as much as you can.
wear sunglass cap and cover
exposed part of your body all
the time use sunscreen thrice
in a day such as 10 am 12 pm
and 3 pm. it has to be applied
all over the face. sunscreen
spf (sun protection factor)
should be around 50. use anti-
pigmentation cream over
pigmented parts like kojic acid
hydroquinone depiwhite
cream etc. in the night. ideal
treatment is glycolic acid
peels. sittings of six to eight
peels must be required. post
acne scars are three types.
box scar ice-pick (pinpoint
scars) and rolling scars.
pinpoint scars are difficult to
treat while box scars are easy.
no cream or tablet can help
you out in scars. best
technique is co2 fractional
laser and subscision. it takes
five to six sitting but results
are better than any other
procedure. dermaroller and
subscision are also other
methods but less effective
than the above. fillers do have
hiding effect. it fills the pits
and gives impression of
fullness and it is not
permanent. if scars are not
much prominent then peels
also could be effective. these
are technique you can go
through. all procedures take
four to five sitting and five to
six months for better results.                           \r\n\r\n\r\n Hello doctor,\nI have

yellowing of teeth is mainly
due to one of the following or
a combination of these: 1)
tartar or plaque deposits (soft
yellowish deposits) on the
teeth. 2) calculus deposits
(calcified hard deposits) on
the teeth. 3) fluorosis - internal
discoloration of the teeth due
to altered fluorine content in
the drinking water. you have
given an excellent description
of the clinical condition of your
oral cavity. from your history it
is very clear that the
yellowness of your teeth is
due to plaque and calculus
deposits. plaque as you have
mentioned is yellowish and
creamy. this gets partially
removed with brushing. calculi
are hard deposits either
yellowish greenish or
sometimes blackish in color.
they are firmly attached to the
teeth and do not go off with
brushing or tooth powder.
even the abrasiveness of the
tooth powder cannot remove
the calculi. during childhood
due to improper brushing
there are chances of plaque
and calculus formation over
the teeth. because children at
this age tend to be playful and
do not concentrate on oral
hygiene. "tooth worms" as
people say are nothing but
bacteria that affect the teeth.
these bacteria act on the teeth
and cause demineralization of
the teeth and lead to tooth
decay and cavities. the lower
incisors and canines are more
prone to plaque and calculus
deposition (v shaped
deposition in accordance with
the tooth morphology) due to
inability of us to reach the
inner sides of these teeth
while brushing. at this age of
yours these deposits may be
due to: 1) improper brushing
technique. 2) brushing only
once a day. 3) malalignment of
your teeth. 4) crowding of your
teeth (due to inadequate
spacing in between the teeth).
5) if you are having any
prosthetic teeth (crown bridge
removable appliances). 6) if
you are undergoing
orthodontic treatment (wire
braces). dental scaling is the
procedure that removes
plaque and calculi. but it does
not mean that these deposits
will not come back again.
continuous oral hygiene
maintenance after scaling is
mandatory to prevent
recurrence of plaque and
calculi. hence scaling is not a
wastage of money it is an
investment to prevent one's

                                                         years. I had my hormone levels
                                                         checked four months ago. The

                                  \r\n\r\n\r\n Hello doctor, I am 45
                                  years old and working as a
                                  senior level finance professional
                                  in a multi-partner practice owned
                                  by all of us. After going through
                                  the high levels of anxiety for
                                  several years, I consulted a
                                  psychologist who is my friend.
                                  After few months of showing little
                                  improvement, he put me on
                                  Escitalopram 10 mg. For about 2
                                  years I took this medicine and
                                  was generally fine. When my
                                  friend moved out of the country, I
                                  shifted to a new doctor and he is
                                  a more senior person. He
                                  changed the drug to Paroxetine
                                  25 mg which I have been on for
                                  the last nine months. I would
                                  probably say I am doing better
                                  now than before. The issue is
                                  regarding further counseling.
                                  While my friend did not feel that
                                  there is a need to continue
                                  counseling once he put me on
                                  the medicine. But, the new one
                                  seems to feel that I should
                                  resume counseling. Based on
                                  his advise, I went back to the
                                  counselor I originally saw, but
                                  somehow she seems to feel that
                                  I do not need any structured
                                  counseling.\nI am generally a
                                  religious person and try to follow
                                  certain regular spiritual practices
                                  like visiting a temple almost
                                  every day, reading at least a little
                                  from any scripture and do some
                                  chanting. At the same time, I still
                                  have the little odd feelings of
                                  discomfort too at times, though it
                                  does not trouble me so much like
                                  earlier. Specific cause of worry
                                  now is mostly the side effect of
                                  the long-term medication I take
                                  for anxiety, BP (Telmesartan)

                                  concern now is that on most
                                  days I have a general feeling of
                                  boredom as though there is not
                                  anything much to do. Generally, I
                                  try to avoid associating with any
                                  new demanding assignments
                                  because I do not feel
                                  comfortable about doing things
                                  unless I am fully sure about the
                                  work. On the other side, it is also
                                  my dream to be a successful
                                  writer of fiction novels. I have
                                  finished one book, but that has
                                  not found any worthy publisher
                                  so far, which is disappointing.
                                  So, even though I have been
                                  working on my second book, I do
                                  not have too much confidence
                                  that my writing will reach

afib (atrial fibrillation) is also a
type of atrial arrhythmia. the
icd not only provides
treatment for atrial
arrhythmias but also provides
treatment for ventricular
arrhythmias as well as rate-

attempts to gain control over

the pathway of the atrial

ichthyosis as you rightly
mentioned is a genetic
condition leading to
excessively dry and flaky skin.
there is no cure for this
condition but it can be
controlled by using right
medications and thus bringing
the normal texture back. for
the same follow these
suggestions: use a mild soap
like cetaphil soap. use
lukewarm water to bathe and
add liquid paraffin (2 caps full)
in the water. after having the
bath use a cotton wash cloth
to slightly rub off the scales.
this will dislodge the scales.
always pat your skin to make
it dry. use a thick emollient
after bathing like cetaphil dam.
mix cetaphil dam cream and
cotaryl cream in equal
amounts and apply all over the
body. apply cotaryl cream
over the affected area at night.
and whenever you feel the
need of moisturiser just use
plain cetaphil dam. take diet
rich in omega fatty acids such
as fish nuts flax seeds and etc.
once in a week use an oat

you have asked an interesting
question. peanut allergy is one
of the most severe food
allergies. it can cause
itchiness urticaria swelling
eczema sneezing asthma
abdominal pain drop in blood
pressure and cardiac arrest. it
may even result in
anaphylactic death if not
controlled in the right time. the
routes of exposure of the
allergen are mostly the
accidental ingestion of
peanuts or pb by the
concerned person (who is
hypersensitive to peanuts).
air-borne particles in a farm or
factory or crushing
environment may cause
respiratory symptoms in
allergic individuals. however
the odor of peanut butter or its
mere proximity have not
produced any allergic
symptoms in various studies
conducted. hence answering
your questions. it is safe to
carry peanut butter in plane. if
you are carrying it as part of
hand baggage (cabin
baggage) make sure it is
packed properly in a colored
container. this is just to
prevent any psychogenic
allergic symptoms in those
susceptible individuals who
may see the butter and
develop allergy (however such
psychogenic reactions are
very rare but still documented
in studies). since the pb as
such is not an allergen by
sight/proximity/odor a
susceptible person need not
take extra precautions to
avoid allergy when someone                               \r\n\r\n\r\n Hi doctor,\nIs that fine

aggravate during winter
season. it continues from
november till february based
on the climate in your place.
you have not mentioned about
the allergic site (nose or lung
or skin). if it is nose or lung the
dryness due to winter can
trigger the allergic response in
nose. in this situation you
need to maintain moisture by
just applying a drop of coconut
oil in each nostril before going
to bed. on the other hand you
can apply a drop of anu
thailam (an ayurvedic nasal
drops for allergy) in each
nostril before going to bed.
during evenings and nights
when it is too cold you need to
protect your ears (by keeping
cotton plug) nose (by applying
oil drops) head (by covering
head with a woolen cap) and
hands and feet (by wearing
gloves and socks). the
external cold stimulus triggers
the allergic response. so
prevent yourself from the cold
stimulus to avoid allergy. if
you have allergic asthma then
it is better to practice
pranayama and yoga.
breathing exercises will help
you. if you have allergic skin
disorder then you can use
vaseline or vegetable oils to
gently apply on the skin. this

your doctor is right in saying
that your son has allergic
conjunctivitis. eye allergies
called allergic conjunctivitis
are a common condition that
occurs when the eyes react to
something that irritates them
called an allergen. the most
common allergens are dust
and pollens. the eyes produce
a substance called histamine
to fight off the allergen. as a
result the eyelids and
conjunctiva (the thin filmy
membrane that covers the
inside of your eyelids) become
red swollen and itchy with
tearing and burning. the key to
treating eye allergies are
avoid or limit contact with the
substance causing the
problem. avoid rubbing eyes
instead do cold compresses.

olopatadine along with
lubricating eye drop. we

it sounds like your friend is
bothered by the persistent
tingling and numbness in his
left foot. i understand these
sensations can be quite
irritating especially if your
work involves standing for
long periods. did he have
these tingling sensations in
the same areas before the
surgery? if so have these
worsened after the surgery or
remained the same? i assume
his symptoms before the
surgery were also on the left
side and his hemilaminectomy
was also performed on the left
side. it will be nice if i could
see the preoperative mri
images to see what the
hemilaminectomy was done
for. often if the surgery
involves removal of a large
herniated disc or the space
available for the nerve is very
less (stenosis) then the nerve
may get bruised during
surgery due to retraction. this
means that in order to
decompress the nerve the
surgeon has to retract the
nerve to go around the nerve
and remove the compressing
elements. if the compression
is severe the nerve gets
bruised easily and there may
be persistent numbness and
tingling in the areas of the leg
and foot that are
geographically supplied by
that nerve. since the surgeon
has advised him to wait it out i
assume this is likely the case.
swelling of the foot is common
if the nerve supplying that
area is not fully functional. the
weak muscles in the leg and
foot are not able to push the
blood back up towards the
heart and gravity causes this
dependent area to swell up.
this is often seen at the end of
the day and gets better at
night when he sleeps. it is
difficult to predict how long the
tingling will last. it could be a
few months. the fact that there
is tingling and not pure
numbness is actually
encouraging although it is
more irritating to the patient. if
it were a complete nerve injury
then only numbness would be
experienced. the presence of
tingling means that the nerve
is just irritated inflamed and
swollen due to the bruising. if
the tingling is very bothersome
he may try some neuralgic
pain medications like
gabapentin or pregabalin.
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
medications (nsaids) may also
help in this situation. there is a
very rare possibility of other
complications like recurrent
disc herniation other post-
surgical changes irritating the
nerve etc. these are difficult to
diagnose and usually need a
new mri with contrast.
however it is advisable to
delay such investigation for at
least for two to three months

a sinus tachycardia is a sinus
rhythm with an elevated rate
of impulses defined as a rate
greater than 100 beats per

the normal resting heart rate
in an average adult ranges
from 60 to 100 beats per
minute. there are a number of
causes for a sinus

common causes include
anemia smoking (increased
nicotine acts a stimulant) or

bad smell during breathing
could be due to various
reasons. let us see those one
by one. malignancy: an
intranasal (inside the nose) or
intraoral (inside the mouth)
malignancy can produce foul
smell that can be perceived as
faeces smell by the nose.
malignancy can be painless
and without any symptoms.
malignancies of paranasal air
sinuses also produce foul
odor. dental infection: a tooth
decay can produce bad smell.
dental infection usually
produces significant pain. food
particles get collected inside
the decayed tooth and hence
cause the bad smell. sinusitis:
chronic sinusitis can cause
constant post nasal drip and
purulent discharge (pus
discharge). this results in foul
odor. maxillary sinusitis
commonly produces foul odor.
sinusitis will have other
symptoms like headache
facial pain nasal blockage post
nasal drip etc. foreign body
inside nose: a foreign body
which has got stuck inside
nose without being removed
for many days will produce
purulent discharge and smell.
the discharge will be from one
side of the nose. it is common
among kids. foreign body
produces nasal block. atrophic
rhinitis: it is a disease where
the normal space inside the
nose gets increased due to
destruction of the anatomy.
also the condition causes
merciless anosmia (loss of
sensation of smell). the
sufferer cannot perceive any
smell but the people around
him can get the extreme foul
odor emanating from the
patients nose. atrophic rhinitis
also presents with crusting
inside nose and nose block.
maggots in nose: maggots are
larval stage of fly (chrysomia).
maggots usually occur in
association with atrophic
rhinitis. fly lays its eggs inside
nose leading to maggots
inside nose. they are attracted
to the foul odor and they
themselves aggravate the
odor. tonsillitis: pus
accumulated over the tonsil
can cause bad smell. tonsillar
enlargement with infection and
consequent foul breath is
common in many children.
other symptoms of tonsillitis
include fever throat pain
enlarged lymph nodes of neck
difficulty and pain while
swallowing. nasal diphtheria
can produce foul odor.
diphtheria produces a
membrane over the affected
mucosa. rhinitis caseosa: it is
a destructive disease
producing foul odor. it was
thought to be a fungal disease
exact etiology is still not clear.
tuberculosis: tb of nasal
mucosa produces
granulomatous inflammation
and caseating necrosis
consequent death of tissues
and foul smell. hope i have                               \r\n\r\n\r\n Hello doctor,\nI have

after trauma with the ball there
could be many things that can
cause blurring. it could be a
simple eyelid swelling or small
abrasion on the cornea the
front transparent surface of
the eye. other causes may be
inflammation in the eye or
blood inside the eye called
hyphema. sometimes after
trauma pupil dilated due to
sphincter muscle damage and
that also produces blurring.
lens subluxation or small
vitreous hemorrhage can also
cause blurring. after trauma
with the ball there may be
swelling in the back of the eye
(retina) called commotio
retinae - berlin's edema. so
you need a complete eye
examination from an eye
specialist so that the exact
cause of blurring could be
established and treated if
needed. after trauma with the
ball there may be orbital bone
fracture and double vision.
also there is a risk of retinal
detachment in life time and
this may manifest as flashes
floaters or a sudden
decreased vision or a curtain

go to your eye specialist and

lichen planus is a chronic and
self-limiting disease. it has
been seen that skin lesions
subside within 9-12 months in
about 50 percent of the cases.
since you are still developing
fresh lesions you will have to
take a course of tablet
prednisolone 20 mg daily for 6
weeks which can be reduced
gradually. you seem to have
severe itching which is not
responding much to
levocetirizine. i would
recommend you take tablet
hydroxyzine 25 mg twice daily
till the itchy subsides. along
with this apply clobetasol
propionate on the itchy areas.

actually there are many
causes of decreased vision
and itching for which you need
to rub your eyes. please
answer a few questions. since
how long you are using
glasses? when you had your
last refraction? do you have
any eye allergy itching
watering or redness that get
worse in specific season? is
this problem persist all day or
it is more in the morning or
evening? have you got an eye
examination or using any
drops currently? so from the
complaints you described
there may be just a change in
refraction. if your refraction
(glass number) is changing
again and again then you
might need to get a full eye
examination and a few
investigations. in cases with
repeated change in refraction
quickly there are chances of a
condition called keratoconus
in which shape of the cornea
becomes conical and gets
thin. at your age the cause of
excessive rubbing may be
allergic conjunctivitis called
vernal keratoconjunctivitis
(conjunctivitis due to some
seasonal allergy). keratoconus
is more common in people
who have vernal
keratoconjunctivitis. other
causes may some congenital
corneal dystrophy in which
superficial corneal layers are
peeled off with mild rubbing
and cause blurred vision. so i
would advise you to get a
complete eye examination and
your eye doctor can order
some investigations like
corneal topography if needed.                          \r\n\r\n\r\n Hi doctor,I have been

welcome to icliniq. com. the
best oral hygiene
maintenance method is to
brush your teeth with a soft or
medium toothbrush and
fluoride toothpaste. the
electronic toothbrush does not
offer any real additional
benefit to normal individuals. it
is the movements of the
toothbrush made by our
hands that bring about
thorough cleaning. most of the
toothpastes available in the
market are good as long as
they contain up to 1000 ppm
fluoride. brushing three times
is good. the main goal is to
clean the food deposits from
all areas. rinsing the mouth
after meals is good yet a
simple method to keep the
mouth clean. using a
mouthwash causes no real
problem in relation to
upsetting the microflora or
healthy bacteria. you can

you can bleed more
sometimes due to irregular
menses because of hormonal
(chemical) levels of your body
and its effect. but you can
bleed also due to cervical
erosions and infection there. i
personally never recommend
tampons. because your
menstrual blood contains
some bacteria and pathogens
which can infect. and when
you use tampons due to the
collected blood it gives a
media to growth of that
bacteria. the body can resist
infection up to a limit and as
the limit crosses you get signs
and symptoms of infection for
which you may have to take
treatment. now in your case
foul-smelling discharge and
discoloration of the discharge
are the signs of infection. now
i have to see actually where
the infection is. so best
consult your nearby
gynecologist. let him see
where the infection is and
what type of discharge
actually is. and if required then
send the discharge for
examination. by this we will
know the type of infection and                        \r\n\r\n\r\n Hi doctor,\nI am 23

the post-operative swelling
and numbness after mandible
fracture surgery are common.
the swelling is mild as you
have mentioned. then it should
resolve in another one to two
weeks as the tissues heal. the
numbness is because the
mental nerve which runs
through the mandible is hurt at
some point during surgery. it
can last from a few days to
even three months. in most of
the cases the numbness will
fade away automatically when
the nerve regeneration takes
place. you will feel pricking
kind of electric shock at times
during the day as a sign of
nerve healing. but if the
numbness lasts for more than
three months then it should be                         \r\n\r\n\r\n Hi doctor,\nI was

30. 4 kg/m2. generally we
perform bariatric surgery to
achieve permanent weight
loss for any patient whose bmi
is 30 kg/m2 or above.
liposuction is not a treatment
option for weight loss. it is a
cosmetic procedure for body
shaping. there is a set point
for fat storage for everyone.
this is not altered by
liposuction. weight loss by
liposuction diet control
exercise naturopathy amway
herbalife etc. is temporary as
all these methods do not have
any effect on set point for fat
storage. so any fat that is
removed in liposuction will
reaccumulate over a period of
6 months to two years. those
who can reduce weight by diet
control and exercise does not
need liposuction and those
who cannot reduce weight by
above methods will not reduce
even after liposuction. bariatric
surgery provides permanent
weight loss as it lowers set
point for fat storage. if you are
looking for permanent weight

from going through the
information you have provided
it is clear that currently you
are on treatment for
suspected gerd -
gastroesophageal reflux
disease (acid reflux disease).
you have been having
intermittent problems over five
years. acid reflux can cause
breathlessness and waking up
from sleep at night. some
might feel and describe
heartburns but others may not
actually feel the burning
sensation. the symptoms can
be worsened by stress anxiety
and panic attacks. my
recommendations are an
endoscopy procedure called
gastroscopy will help to check
for any weakness in the valve
at the lower end of the food
pipe (gullet or esophagus) and
to directly visualize any
evidence of inflammation
there that is reflux esophagitis.
following the above test you
may require a 24 hour ph
monitoring study and a
manometry test to confirm that
acid is refluxing back
whenever you have symptoms
and that there is no problem
with motility of the gullet. i
agree with you that i would not
continue on perinorm cd
(metoclopramide). i tend to
give it only for nausea or
vomiting. nexpro
(esomeprazole) 40 mg is best
taken once daily in empty
stomach in the morning. if
despite this symptoms persist
it can be taken twice daily
before food that is before
breakfast and the other before
dinner at night. you can take
topcid (famotidine) 40 mg at
bedtime to prevent symptoms
at night. some people with
gerd may find that eliminating
certain food helps to improve
their symptoms. for example
avoiding spicy foods raw
onion garlic black pepper
citrus products and juices of
orange grapefruit or cranberry
tomato products chocolate or
brownies caffeine sodas
coffee tea etc. peppermint

the heavy bleeding may be
due to the fibroid and
menopausal symptoms.
hence we need to treat fibroid
and hormonal imbalance. for
your condition i suggest you
try taking the following
medicines. consult your
specialist doctor discuss with
him or her and start taking the
medicines after their consent.
tablet aloes compound two
tablets thrice a day. capsule
rasagandhi mezhugu one
tablet twice a day. tablet
chitramoola kuligai one tablet
twice a day. you need to
continue these drugs for three
months. within one week the
bleeding will stop. then
gradually the uterine fibroid
will be reduced in size. after
few more months your uterus
will become normal. if you can
collect or buy the bark of
jambul tree crush 50 gm of the
bark with 300 ml of water. boil
in mild flame and reduce it to
50 ml. then drink it. this should
be consumed in the morning
and evening on an empty
stomach. this has the potential
to stop the excess bleeding.

at the age of 24 year it is
unlikely that you have ulcer in
the stomach. it could be gerd
(gastroesophageal reflux
disease) that is causing all
these symptoms but after long
time it may cause ulcer. if you
are not responding to ppis
(proton-pump inhibitors) then it
could be h. pylori infection that
is causing the problem. the
investigations you have
mentioned are not having
much abnormalities except
mild anaemia. the
management of gerd
symptoms include medicines
as well as dietary
modifications and exercise
with position maneuvers.
usually we do not do
investigations but if it is not
responding to medicines then
it is needed. advice:tablet                                 \r\n\r\n\r\n Hello Doctor,\nI have

with a glass of warm water or
preferably with a glass of
buttermilk and have it 10
minutes after dinner. this
powder will be salty to taste.
3. jeerakadyarishtam - a liquid
preparation. 3 teaspoon of this

of water and take after food
twice daily. you can take this
after breakfast and lunch. 4.

well weight loss is a very
gradual process and the
treatment includes
management of diet a regular
exercise regime and in the
end medicine. many of the
patients achieve desired
results with strict diet and
lifestyle modifications.
homoeopathic treatment for
weight loss or for any disease
depends upon what kind of
personality and constitution
the patient has. calcarea carb
is although a very good
medicine for weight loss but
does not work in every case.
so instead of this you may
start up with phytolacca berry
tablets of reckeweg which is
specifically known for weight
loss. you can consult me for
weight loss diet plan also. for
your back pain i feel it might
be due to extra weight and
weakness of back muscles.
both these factors contributing
to back pain will be taken care
once you start with regular
exercise. no medicine can
help you no matter how much
you take if your back pain is
because of these two
reasons. if problem still persist
then you can consult me. but

you have not mentioned the
specific site where you get the
pain. is it in and around the
nipple or is it deep inside? if
the pain is in and around the
nipple then it is most likely due
to faulty technique while
feeding. these are the
instructions for proper
breastfeeding technique:
make sure that you insert not
only the nipple but the whole
areola (the dark colored area
around the nipple) into baby's
mouth. by this way the nipple
lies touching the baby's hard
palate while sucking. also do
not forget to rest the baby's
head in the corner of your
elbow. while feeding your
baby's tummy should touch
your tummy. now considering
that you are not doing any
faulty technique or posture
and still getting the pain deep
inside: it could be due to
opening of milk ducts each
time the baby sucks. also
check out if there is any
congestion i. e milk clogging in
your breast. also see for any
crack in your nipple which is
very common in the initial
days of lactation. examine

                                                         pressure (less than 118/75
                                                         mmHg). About five months back,
                                                         I felt feverish and visited a
                                                         hospital for the same. That time,
                                                         I came to know that my blood
                                                         pressure had risen to 145/85
                                                         mmHg. Since then, my life has
                                                         never remained the same. My
                                                         parents are not hypertensive. I
                                                         was having chest pain and
                                                         sleeping problems from then. I
                                                         was given Nifedipine for blood

the symptoms you have
mentioned here are indicating
towards a migraine headache.
however no diagnostic test
can surely rule out a migraine.
its diagnosis is mainly based
on the symptoms. in a
migraine there is no definite
pain and pain occurs at any
time. some people say that a
migraine usually occurs on
one side of the head and is
accompanied by nausea and
vomiting but this is not true in
all cases. the pain can be all
over the head and other
symptoms might be present or
absent. i suggest you try doing
the following. wear
sunglasses cover your head
with a scarf and use an
umbrella whenever you go out
in the sun. before going
outside always drink one glass
of water it will keep you
hydrated and will help you.
you can take sandalwood oil
and massage your scalp a
night before washing your
hair. avoid excessive intake of
tea coffee and caffeinated
drinks. some foods also
increase the problem of
headaches so avoid those.
avoid using perfumes
deodorant sprays etc. as
strong smell may exaggerate
the problem. avoid stress
anxiety and loud noises. follow
a particular sleep pattern i
mean try to sleep daily around
the same time. if possible try
to avoid mobile television
laptop etc. an hour before
sleep as these emit blue light
which hinders normal sleep
pattern and also promotes
headaches. pranayam is
helpful in headaches. so if you
can spare 5 to 10 minutes
then practice it daily. in
medications i suggest you try
taking the following. consult
your specialist doctor discuss
with him or her and start
taking the medicines after
their consent. pathyadi kwath
15 to 20 ml with an equal
amount of water twice a day
for six weeks. godanti bhasma
250 mg with water twice a day
for four to six weeks. it is an
ayurvedic painkiller. shir
shuladi vajra ras two tablets
twice a day with water for four
to six weeks. this ayurvedic
medicine is also a painkiller
and is used in headaches of
various etiology. if you find it
tedious to take multiple
medicines then you can take
only one of these two
painkillers or can take two of
them for one month.
kamdudha ras 250 mg twice a
day with water for four to six
weeks. it will help in cooling
you down internally. take anu
taila and put one drop of this
oil in each nostril once a day
for one month. take powder of
sandalwood camphor and
jatamansi and. mix all in equal
amount and add water or rose
water and apply this paste on
the forehead while you have a
headache. take one teaspoon
of coriander powder and add it
in one cup of water and keep
it for a night. drink it early in
the morning on an empty
stomach. if you are taking
allopathic medicine then take
above medicine along with
that after consulting your
physician. however for a
migraine there is no curative
treatment. it can only be
avoided with the help of
medicines and lifestyle
changes and sometimes the
headache may not disturb you
for so long and sometimes
may trouble you often so            \r\n\r\n\r\n Hello doctor,\nI get

                                                         and tingling in both legs from the
                                                         knee down. For some time now,
                                                         probably 6 months or more, I
                                                         also began feeling that my legs
                                                         were heavy and just general
                                                         weakness all over, not really
                                                         muscle weakness. I am also a
                                                         gastric bypass patient and have
                                                         a history of low B12, iron
                                                         saturation and low vitamin D. To
                                                         complicate matters even more, I
                                                         went to an orthopedic spine
                                                         specialist about a month ago,
                                                         due to the stiffness in my neck. I
                                                         was unable to turn side to side
                                                         and this has been going on for
                                                         several years, like 5 or more.
                                                         Also, I have a sharp pain
                                                         between my shoulder blades. My

                                                         compression of the spinal cord.

premature ejaculation can
cause significant distress to a
person. if your erectile
dysfunction is persistent then i
would advise you to get your
serum testosterone and
serum prolactin done to rule
out any hormonal cause. if
that comes back normal then
most likely the cause of your
problem is psychological. for
erectile dysfunction medicines
like sildenafil and tadalafil are
used. these are pde-5 inhibitor
drugs and have great efficacy
in improving erection. the drug
can be used even on sos
basis (as and when required)
about half to one hour before
intercourse. for early
discharge medicines like
dapoxetine are used. the drug
helps to delay the ejaculation
time and thus help to solve

inhibition of conversion of
testosterone to its more active
and potent form of
dihydrotestosterone. thus the
side effects may include loss
of libido erectile dysfunction
low mood irritability and
depression. although the
frequency of such adverse
effects is not very high but
they are potentially frustrating.
sometimes reduced libido may
not be due to a direct side
effect of dutasteride but is
purely psychological. but still if
you have noted significant
reduction in sexual desire and
erection i suggest you stop the
medication. with prolonged
use the condition may be
irreversible and no doubt that
would be more troublesome
than loss of hair. let me give

i clearly understand your
symptoms. the basic reason
behind the whole issue is the
autonomic imbalance which
your nervous system shows to
specific sensory inputs. let me
simplify that thing for you. all
the senses give input to our
brain like smell vision taste
hearing and touch. out of
these five the first two can
have relatively major influence
on our autonomic nervous
system. the autonomic
nervous system is the part of
nervous system which
regulates blood circulation
digestion respiration cardiac
rhythm etc. the alteration of
blood flow in the brain
produces those flashes of
light and sometimes a lost
patch of vision in a field. now
people with migraine have

autonomic regulations and

                                                     gradually reduced the dose to

                                                          weeks ago, I was admitted to
                                                          hospital with a viral infection and
                                                          stayed in the hospital for two
                                                          nights. During viral infection, I
                                                          woke up early in the morning
                                                          shaking uncontrollably and my
                                                          heart rate was 152, so the
                                                          ambulance took me to
                                                          the hospital. I was told that I
                                                          have a viral infection and chest
                                                          infection. One and a half weeks
                                                          later, I went to work and started
                                                          getting very bad palpitations. So,
                                                          I went straight to hospital where
                                                          they kept me in for five nights.
                                                          They put me on Propranolol to
                                                          calm my heart rate down when it
                                                          starts to race. What happens is
                                                          that I will get an ectopic beat
                                                          which feels very uncomfortable
                                                          in my chest and causes me to
                                                          panic, then my heart rate goes
                                                          very high, and that cycle
                                                          continues for a while. So, the

i guess you are taking
combination pill that is
hormonal contraceptives
containing both estrogen and
progestin (synthetic
progesterone). these act by
preventing your ovulation and
making your cervical mucus
thicker. you need to take
combination pills within five
days after the start of the
period. then you need not
follow other means of
contraception. you may start
combination pills at any time
and only concern is that you
will be protected from
pregnancy 7 days from then.
yes you need not take pills in
the fourth week and this will
initiate your withdrawal
bleeding that is you will have a
menstrual bleed in that week
and you will be protected.
some measures you need to
follow. you need to ensure that
you take these pills regularly
at the same time each day. if
you vomit immediately

let me share some facts about
viral infection of eye. primary
viral infection of the eye is
usually followed by recurrent
infection that may involve any
or all layers of cornea. cornea
has three layers: epithelium
stroma and endothelium. it is
when the stroma affected it
causes stromal keratitis. this
may be due to direct infection
or your own body's immune
response to viral antigens.
most common viral keratitis is
herpes simplex viral keratitis.
stromal keratitis is usually
recurrent. the treatment
prescribed to you is according
to the protocol. you need to
ensure that you use them
accordingly and apply topical
medication five times daily. the
response should be evident by
two to four days. if not then
you can change from acyclovir
to ganciclovir ophthalmic gel
0. 15% five times daily or
trifluridine 1% drops nine
times daily. topical
corticosteroid pred forte
(prednisolone) is to bring
down your immune response
and is thus indicated in
immune mediated non-
necrotizing stromal keratitis.
debridement can sometimes
be tried according to the
lesion. antiviral medications
should not be taken for more
than 10 to 14 days as they
cause epithelial toxicity.
patients with frequent
recurrences of ocular hsv may
be placed on a long-term
regimen of oral antiviral
medication at the prophylactic
maintenance dose.

is determined by the following
factors: duration of the sleep.
sleep-wake timings. number

drowsiness. any distress or
dysfunction associated with
sleep disturbances. as you
told that you are sleeping for
about 8 hours at night and
your age is 24 years this is an
adequate sleep at this age (6-
8 hours). however if you still
feel sleepy during your office

inadequate sleep in terms of
quality of sleep. ensure that
you are sleeping at an
adequate time and getting up
at adequate time in morning.

night which reduces the quality
of sleep. besides this few
other things also hamper

stimulant abuse. underlying
physical illness. lack of
interest in work boredom and

changes that you can make at

there are lot of medical issues
which can occur from tattooing
like hiv infection tetanus
hepatitis b and c and allergic
reactions. nowadays tattooists
reduced such risks by
following universal
precautions working with
single use items and sterilizing
their equipment after each
use. as you mentioned your
piercing was done only till the
epidermis the infection is
highly unlikely (very very less
chance) that you will contact
any infection. even if the
needle was infected it requires
contact with body fluids like
blood. so you can relax. still i
would like to make the
following points:- in case of an
hiv infection the test takes
about 2-3 months to be
positive. hence there is no
way to find out if you got
infected which is again highly
unlikely. there is something
called post-exposure
prophylaxis (pep) given to
individuals who have been
exposed to the virus and
includes three drugs given
only under doctor's
supervision. you can discuss
this with your doctor. if you
frequently get a tattoo done
make sure your tetanus and                              \r\n\r\n\r\n Hi doctor,\nFour days

one thing for sure is that he is
having periodic hemolysis with
adequate bone marrow
response and he has a severe
vitamin b12 deficiency. his
corrected rpi (reticulocyte
production index) is 2. 7%
which means that his bone
marrow is responding to the
anemia appropriately. the
broad differential here would
be medication induced
hypothyroidism vitamin b12
folate deficiency lead
poisoning alcoholism and
hemolysis due to ssd (sickle
cell disease) or liver disease
since he has transaminitis and
elevated bilirubin. elevated ldh
(lactate dehydrogenase)
elevated reticulocyte count
and low haptoglobin are
indicators of hemolysis. he
has splenomegaly as well
which again favors either a
chronic liver disease or most
likely hemolysis. however the
only tricky portion is his low
wbc (white blood count). i do
not think that it is a bone
marrow process. it is more like
peripheral destruction or
nutritional deficiency. i do see
that the vitamin b12 is very
low at 209 and he has a
normal g6pd level (glucose-6-
phosphate dehydrogenase). i

all these problems of periods
are due to overweight. your
expected weight is around 55
kg to 60 kg. it is easy to say
just to reduce. but it is quite
impossible to reduce so much.
please put some effort to do it
for at least 2 to 5 kg per
month. it is a start. reduce all
high calories diet and junk
bakery food. but you should
not fast. have regular exercise
especially for the middle
segment of the body like
aerobics or brisk walk. all the
fat in the body gets converted
to hormones. you would have
seen big men having breast as
their fat is producing the
female hormone. this hormone
will affect the normal cycle of
ovulation and you will not get
the periods regularly. your fat
distribution will be mainly
around mid-segment such as
thighs breast back and hip but
not below knees and elbows.
also there will be black

i had gone through all the data
posted. the treatment duration
for b12 deficiency depends
upon the cause severity and
symptoms. for example
vitamin b12 deficiency is
common in strict vegetarians.
so we advise them to take
injection daily once
intramuscularly for one week
and then weekly once for four
weeks and then monthly once
in six months. if pernicious
anemia is the cause where
there is a defect in the
absorption of vitamin b12 then
we will advise to take the
same course for a longer
duration. it also depends up
on the signs and symptoms
like low hemoglobin
neuropathy etc. so if you are a
strict vegetarian or the cause
of b12 deficiency has not been
evaluated then i suggest tablet
containing b12 1000 mcg
weekly two days. kindly review                           \r\n\r\n\r\n Hi doctor,\nI had

success and failure are the
two sides of the same coin.
you can never predict what
will happen. life is never a
smooth sailing boat. it is full of
ups and downs. life does not
end when you fail once. life is
much more than your exams.
you gain experience when you
go through failures and
hardships. you become tough
and will learn to handle more
difficult situations in the future.
if you have fallen down get up
and pursue your goal. be
persistent till you achieve your
goal. all great people gone
through failures before they
become successful in life.
success will come when you
are optimistic. be brave and
face life. for further information                         \r\n\r\n\r\n Hi doctor,I failed in my

i read your query and
understand your concerns.
although we assume in one or
the other way but it is not like
that. the fact is first someone
becomes topper successful
and then his style are
appreciated leading to wider
recognition. we as a society
focus more on successful
people and try to imitate them
in the way of writing or
dressing but it is not the style
which makes somebody a
topper. it is the hard work and
intelligence that make you
topper. i mean to say that
things are in different order.
like successful person leads to
the identification of his style.
so you definitely need to get
into how you can achieve
something rather than trying to
imitate others. do not have                                 \r\n\r\n\r\n Hello doctor,\nI feel

understand your concern.
acne has several grades
depending on the type of
lesions. in grade 1 i prefer to
advise topical clindamycin in
the morning and benzoyl
peroxide alternatively with
topical retinoids in the night-
time. oral antibiotics are also
given like doxycycline or
minocycline or azithromycin in
grade 2-4 acne. avoid hair oil
application and oily food in the
diet. in responding cases
consideration is given to start
oral retinoids. kindly upload

every person has numerous
traits or habits. a person is
sum total of his thoughts
words and actions. when you
think of judging a person it is
making a global judgment. if
you really need to be objective
you need to judge a person's
actions habits and thoughts
individually. but i get what you
mean to ask. here are my
thoughts on it: judge a person
by how much he contributes
to the welfare of others. judge
a person on the basis of his
thoughts. it is only thought
which defines an individual.
judge a person by his actions
in the past and present. judge
on the basis of how he treats
his subordinates because
there is only way of treating
the boss. judge on the basis
of his behavior during crisis
not when things are going
great. judge on the basis of
what he does for the welfare
of others not on the basis of
how much he earns. judge on
the basis of his common
sense not his qualifications.
judge not on his looks but on
how he makes others feel.
another thing to note is that it
is neither wise nor necessary
to judge people all the time.
no one has perfect judgment.
because judgment is
subjective and based only on
available facts not on the                               \r\n\r\n\r\n Hi doctor,\nI am a 21

the treatment includes some
medicines and psychotherapy.
1) medication includes
antidepressants (ssri's tci)
antianxiety drugs. it is better
to see some doctor before
taking any medicine as the
best medication for your panic
attacks will depend on a
variety of factors like
presenting symptoms co
morbid disorders and
treatment goals. 2)
psychotherapy (cbt i. e
cognitive behaviour therapy)
treatment of panic attacks. cbt
works to help the patient to
change his thoughts and
perceptions that are
contributing to fear and
anxiety. once you begin to
accept panic attacks you can
start to change the way you
respond to them. for example
instead of reacting to physical
symptoms with nerve-racking
thoughts such as “i am losing
control ” you can respond to
them with increased calm and
clarity. relaxation techniques
such as deep breathing
mindfulness meditation or
yoga can be practised to help
you get in touch with your
relaxation response. repeating
positive affirmations such as
“despite my anxiety i accept
myself ” can also help in
getting past fear. by working
on changing how you react
you can start to remain in
control during panic attacks.
the next time you have a panic
attack try to remember the
three a’s of overcoming your
fears: acknowledge accept
and alternative response.
these three steps can assist
you in changing the way you
react to symptoms and get
through panic attacks with
less fear. listed here is a
simple step-by-step exercise
that can help you overcome
your fear of panic attacks:
acknowledge - the next time
you notice increased anxiety
or panic symptoms simply
pause and take a breath. take
this moment to recognize that
you are experiencing
heightened panic and anxiety.
this simple act of
acknowledging your
symptoms at the start of a
panic attack can give you a
sense of power over your
fears. accept - rather than
trying to run away from or
resist your symptoms come to
terms with the fact that you
are having a panic attack.
acceptance does not mean
that you are giving in to panic
but can provide you with the
clarity needed to get through
panic attacks. alternative
response - instead of
becoming wrapped up in your
fear remind yourself that these
are simply symptoms of a
panic attack and that you have
nothing to be afraid of. during
a panic attack your flight-or-
fight reaction may be trigger
feelings of stress and fear.
reframing these feelings can
allow you to more effectively
cope with them. so for
example if during an attack
you start to react with fear or a
need to flee remind yourself
that your symptoms will soon
subside. instead of thinking “i
am afraid of my panic attack ”
try to reframe this to “i am
feeling overly excited. ” when
frightening thoughts such as “i
am going to lose my mind”
arise try to shift this perception
be repeating to yourself “i am                          \r\n\r\n\r\n Hello Doctor,\nI had a

                                                       have a problem while urinating
                                                       from past two years. I have
                                                       consulted my urologist, and we
                                                       did many tests like urine culture,

                                                       doctor said there is no problem
                                                       in my urinary tract. A few months
                                                       later, I visited the same doctor,
                                                       and he asked me to do
                                                       thyroid profile test and

not hide any suspected lung
cancer when given before

ray is a basic investigation
used to screen the lungs field
and heart and usually done as
a routine investigation. a
routine chest x-ray usually
picks up any nodules or mass
in the lung fields that might
represent lung cancer and is
not affected by the patient
taking nebulization therapy. if
there are strong reasons to
suspect a lung cancer then a

investigation and gives

the lungs. in conclusion

firstly let me tell you that
sonography is not always
suggestive of adenomyosis. it
cannot diagnose it. for
diagnosis you have to send

adenomyosis there is pain
before during and after
menses. there is also focal
and diffuse type of
adenomyosis. whatever you
read on the internet is about
diffuse or generalized

these problems as you are
having. semen is produced
daily. so even if you do daily
there is no harm. but too much

yes you are right.
hypothyroidism can affect the
fetal brain development
especially in early pregnancy.
thyroid hormone is normally
very important for many
functions of the body. it helps
in the early development of
the fetus. the brain is one of
the parts of early organ
development. in early
pregnancy fetus mainly
depends on mother's thyroid
level because fetus itself
cannot produce up to around
11 to 12 weeks (three
months). there is no data
available whether you have
taken treatment early and
adequately. but yes there is
data that hypothyroidism can
affect brain development and
function in baby permanently
and whatever damage occurs
is irreversible. if you are taking
thyroxine (levothyroxine) 50
mg and the level is this high
then you need to increase the
dose. and if you have started
treatment just now then
continue and repeat according
to the doctor. as far as
termination is concerned that
is totally the couple's call. if
you are prepared to take care
of a mentally handicapped
baby and related problems for
the rest of life then you can
definitely continue. if you are
not prepared for that then you
can go for termination. first
control thyroid level and then
try for pregnancy after you
have a normal thyroid level.

by 50% in pregnancy. you
need to increase the dose to

i suggest you tablet folvite 5
mg of folic acid one tablet per
day. the recommended dose
of folic acid is a controversial
topic. various doctors favor 1
mg to 5 mg per day. the best
part is that the folic acid has
no side effects. it is a water-
soluble vitamin and an excess
of it gets excreted in urine. so
we recommend 5 mg per day
to all our patients. when
sufficient dose is harmless
there is no need to take a
chance by giving low doses.

                                                           death. I am a non-smoker and I
                                                           do not drink alcohol.\nMy
                                                           concern is that I suffer regularly
                                                           with aches and pains in my legs,
                                                           soles of feet, arms, shoulders
                                                           and my chest. I do suffer
                                                           costochondritis. The pain is
                                                           never severe; it is more of a dull
ache or a pulling sensation. If I
had to rate the pain out of 10, I
would say the discomfort is not
more than 1 or 2 and maybe 3 at
the worst. I feel that I have
severe health anxiety and I do
regularly check my pulse, blood
oxygen and blood pressure. I
have had numerous ECGs and
of which, I will attach three for
your reference. I have also had a
coronary calcium score before 5
years, which was zero. I have
had every blood test, including
cardiac enzymes a number of
times and my blood work is
always normal except for
borderline low testosterone. My
cholesterol also in borderline and
I am managing it through
diet.\nInitially, I had chest pain
before six years. I had a
consultation with my GP and he
organized a coronary calcium
score due to a dramatically
elevated cholesterol level. CCS
was normal and I began a
treatment of Atorvastatin. There
was no further issue for the next
three years. Then, when I was
involved in moving a disabled
person from a high rise
apartment and was lugging
furniture and other household
items up and down five flights of
stairs, I felt unwell, chest
discomfort and pain in the arms.
Also, I felt dizzy and fast pulse. I
attended A and E promptly and
they performed an ECG. But, it
showed nothing and cardiac
enzymes were also normal. The
only thing there was an inverted
T-wave, which the cardiologist
was not concerned with as it was
only in one lead.\nTwo years
ago, I attended A and E again
with chest pain. Another ECG
was performed along with a
chest x-ray and all of which were
normal. I was kept in overnight
for routine observation and in the
morning I was visited by a
cardiologist. He felt that the issue
was muscular and not cardiac in
origin and I was subsequently
sent home. Before 10 months, I
attended my GP surgery to
discuss my past and was told
that it was a likely anxiety
disorder. To settle my mind, I
asked my GP to perform an
ECG and the machine
autogenerated a diagnosis of
possible peri-infarction age
undetermined. This subsequently
triggered a panic episode. My
GP checked it and said if I had
been presented this ECG without
the autogenerated diagnosis
then he would say it was a
perfectly normal ECG. As I
asked for a second opinion, he
sent my diagnosis to a
cardiologist. The reply sent was I
find it highly unlikely that this
gentleman has ever had an MI.
However, if he is still concerned,
then consider a referral for stress
echocardiogram.\nI opted for the
stress echo. When I met with the
consultant cardiologist, he told
me that it was not anything to
worry about as everything
appeared normal and was
                                     basically an anxiety based. He
                                     advised no further tests
                                     necessary and discharged me as
                                     healthy with a diagnosis of GAD.
                                     Before three months, I attended
                                     A and E with chest pain and
                                     discomfort following a stressful
                                     day. Another ECG was taken
                                     and everything was normal
                                     apart from Q waves in lead 3. A
                                     and E consultant examined ECG
                                     and reported no change from
                                     earlier ECGs. A month later, I
                                     had an ambulance call out to the
                                     home address. Two ECGs were
                                     taken in one hour difference. The
                                     first again showed inferior
                                     infarction, age undetermined and
                                     QRS duration (corrected) 491
                                     ms. Ambulance crew said it is
                                     fine and otherwise a normal
                                     ECG. All other observations are
                                     normal with oxygen 99% and
                                     somewhat high BP. It was likely
                                     anxiety again. The second ECG
                                     showed a normal QRS duration
                                     and no other issues. I was
                                     advised to see GP for anxiety
                                     medicines\nI visited my GP last
                                     month. He repeated ECG again
                                     and it was normal. He gave me
                                     Sertraline and said based on my
                                     entire history that it is definitely
                                     not a cardiac chest pain. From
                                     last month, I started a new job at
                                     the hospital. Due to shoulder
                                     pain and leg pain, I attended A
                                     and E and an ECG was
                                     performed allegedly and it did
                                     not show any of the previous Q
                                     waves from earlier ECG's and
                                     appeared completely normal.
                                     The cardiac enzymes were taken
                                     and were reported normal. The
                                     final diagnosis was anxiety. Yet,

the best way to reduce weight
is by regular physical exercise
and balanced diet. you can
lose weight by reducing your
intake of oily food and sweets.
it is also important to space
your meals in such a way that
you have more frequent small
meals (and not heavy meals).
regular physical exercise in
the form of some cardio and
strength training will make you
fit and strong. sleep and
hydration are equally
important when you try to lose
weight. ensure that you take
lots of fluids and that you get
at least 6-8 hours of sleep per
day. medicine to lose weight:
as a doctor i never really
recommend my patients to
take medicines to lose weight.
only one drug is approved for
use in india- orlistat. if you
really want to take it you can
take tablet orlistat 60mg thrice
a day (after your 3 major
meals). as i have seen in
practice and also research
results say that orlistat does
not produce too much change
in weight. it shows just a small
percentage of weight loss
when coupled with low-calorie
diet and exercise. and orlistat
has its own share of side
effects: fatty/oily stool oily
spotting intestinal gas with
discharge a feeling of needing
to have a bowel movement
right away increased number
of bowel movements or poor
bowel control. rare but serious
side effects can occur:
symptoms of liver disease
(such as persistent
nausea/vomiting severe
stomach/abdominal pain dark
urine yellowing eyes/skin)
symptoms of kidney stones
(such as back pain pain while
urinating pink/bloody urine).
bottom line: i do not
recommend medicines for
weight loss. i can make a good
diet chart and exercise
regimen for you if you would

i assure you not to worry as
everything is going to be fine if
proper care and treatment is
opted in for. i have thoroughly
gone through your case and
can well understand your
genuine health concerns. the
probable causes:the scrotal
issues are due to the dryness
of the skin and skin hair follicle
infection. there is
hyperkeratosis on the scrotal
skin. all of these issues
develop due to unhygienic
urogenital habit and
unhygienic skin condition of
the areas of the external
genitalia. no need to worry as i
am suggesting very effective
remedies for you to get better
in a short period. the mouth
sores are due to throat
infection and it looks like a
mixture of bacterial and viral
infection. so you need to start
the treatment immediately.

medical remedy for you is to
